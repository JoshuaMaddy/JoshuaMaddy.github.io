            I'm a motivated and goal-oriented software developer with a passion 
            for web development and artificial intelligence. My expertise lies in 
            popular programming languages such as Python and C#, and I'm constantly 
            learning new skills to enhance my knowledge. Outside of work, I enjoy 
            exploring my creative side through visual arts and hobby modeling.

                    I've spent over three years honing my python development

                    Primarily with Unity, I've been using C# to create VR based

                    web applications from scratch with quick turnaround and high
                    modularity. I use Jinja with Flask to create dynamic elements

                    For three years I've been using the Unity Engine to create 
                    experimental VR experiences for the classroom. From the fine

                    Since 2016 I've been using Blender as a creative outlet and
                    a tool. With experience in asset and character creation, as 
                    well as rigging, sculpting, retopology, and animation, I've 
                    explored much of what it has to offer.

                    Blender lacks CAD features, so I've supplemented it with 
                    Fusion 360. I've designed miniature pinball cabinets, 
                    functional 3D prints for my home, and mockups of room layouts
                    as both a hobbyist and student.

                    The Metaphysical Museum is a long-term virtual reality based

                    inspire students to take deeper dives into the presented topics.
                    The first wing focuses on the fine arts - a personal passion - 
                    and introduces students to various periods of art history. The 
                    second in progress wing, funded by the WV NASA Consortium, 
                    focuses on space and space exploration. By using the Unity XR
                    Toolkit, the application is cross-compatible with all leading
                    VR platforms, including the Meta Quest 2 and HTC Vive/Pro.

                    Going through Physics I, I would often make mental and paper 
                    models of systems to rationalize interactions. As part of the 
                    2022 Summer Undergraduate Research Experience at Marshall 
                    University, I attempted to bring these mental models closer to 
                    reality by leveraging augmented reality. By projecting and 
                    manipulating common systems, students would have a deeper 
                    understanding of the interactions without the expense of lab 
                    equipment. This was my first project in Unity, and it involved
                    custom UI renderers and procedural meshes in-engine. The code 
                    for the project is

                    As an avid researcher at Marshall University I would often get
                    asked by my peers how I was able to get a research position.
                    I would also be asked by faculty if I knew of a good candidate.
                    From these conversations, I identified that there was a disconnect
                    between motivated students and searching faculty.
                    The goal of Research Search is to create a closed ecosystem at 
                    Marshall University to connect these two parties. Built on Flask,
                    Jinja, SQLAlchemy, Alembic, and jQuery, the application is light
                    and easily customizable.

                    For Software Engineering 1, my team developed a web application
                    for storing information about tabletop roleplaying games, such
                    as a character, their information, inventories, items, homes,
                    friends, family, familiars, etc. We designed the database to be
                    highly interconnected, allowing for traversal from any table to
                    any other table through logical ORM mapping via SQLAlchemy. 
                    Using my familiar Flask, Jinja, SQLAlchemy, and jQuery
                    technology stack, the team coordinated and delivered a
                    minimum viable product within the semester. The code for the
